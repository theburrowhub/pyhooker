# Custom scripts

This directory contains custom scripts to work with the data of the request and build a response.

To launch a script you need to call the path `/scripts/{script_name}`.

```bash 
curl -X POST http://{URL}/scripts/{script_name}
```

In the doc folder you can find an example of script.
